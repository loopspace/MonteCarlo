	<h3>Help</h3>
	<p>
	  This website allows you to run probability experiments.
	  You can flip coins, roll dice, and deal cards.
	  You can specify various parameters, explained below.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The conditions for stopping an experiment or run of
	  experiments and the counts that can be recorded use a
	  particular syntax.
	  The basic element is <code>count(...)</code> which counts
	  the number of occurences of an event within an experiment.
	  For keeping track between experiments, there
	  is <code>total(...)</code>.
	  These can also be used in the "recording" fields.
	  Logical and mathematical expressions using these can be
	  used.
	  Examples are given in the explanations below.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Type of experiment</span>: You can
	    choose whether to flip coins, roll dice, or deal cards.
	    Some of the other options depend on which you chose.
	</ul>
	<h4>Coins</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Number of coins</span> flipped
	    in each individual experiment.
	  <li><span class="desc">(Un)Biased</span>: It is possible to
	    specify a bias for the coins.
	    The bias is the probability of flipping a head.
	  <li><span class="desc">(Un)Ordered</span>: When more than
	    one coin is flipped, the results can be recorded either
	    ordered or unordered.  If unordered, the results are
	    sorted so that heads are listed first.
	</ul>
	<h4>Dice</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Number of dice</span> rolled
	    in each individual experiment.
	  <li><span class="desc">(Un)Biased</span>: It is possible to
	    specify a bias for the dice.
	    The biases are given by listing the probabilities of
	    getting each number in order separated by commas.
	    Empty entries are allowed: the "left over" probability is
	    equally distributed between any empty entries.
	    Thus a bias of <code>,,,,,.5</code> for a 6-sided die
	    assigns a probability of .5 to rolling a 6 with all other
	    numbers equally likely.
	  <li><span class="desc">(Un)Ordered</span>: When more than
	    one dice is rolled, the results can be recorded either
	    ordered or unordered.  If unordered, the results are
	    sorted so that smaller numbers are listed first.
	  <li><span class="desc">Sides</span>: Various standard sized
	    dice are allowed.  Note that when, for example, a 12-sided
	    die is used then if needed the values are reported with a
	    leading zero to make them all the same length.  So rolling
	    an 11 then a 2 is distinguishable from rolling a 1 then a
	    12 (1102 versus 0112).
	</ul>
	<h4>Cards</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Number of cards</span>.  With cards,
	    the situation is that there is a pack of cards of a given
	    size which is shuffled and then a number of hands of a fixed
	    size are dealt from that pack (without replacement).
	    So the details to specify are the number of hands, the
	    size of each hand, and the size of the deck.
	    At present, the largest deck size is 52.
	    Hands are considered to be unordered, so are reported in
	    the natural order with ace low.
	    Cards are displayed as, for
	    example, <code>4<span class="redsuit">&#9829;</span></code>,
	    but when matching
	    use <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>H</code>, <code>S</code>
	    for the suits.
	</ul>
	<h4>Other Details</h4>	    
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Updating every ...</span>: The
	    website lists all of the experiments, but with a long run it can
	    be slow to update every flip/roll/deal.
	  <li><span class="desc">Until</span>: This gives a condition
	    for when a given run of experiments should be stopped.
	    The examples are all in terms of coins.
	    <ul>
	      <li><code>count() = 10</code> Stop when the number of runs is
		10.
	      <li><code>count(h) = 10</code> Stop when the number of
		heads is 10.
	      <li><code>count(h) = 10 or count(t) = 10</code> Stop
		when the number of heads is 10 or the number of tails is
		10.
	      <li><code>count(hht) = 3</code> Stop when the pattern
		"HHT" has been seen three times.
	      <li><code>count(hh,tt) = 1</code> When flipping two
		coins, stop when two heads are followed by two tails.
	      <li><code>count(hh) = 1 or count(th) = 1</code> Stop
	      when either HH or TH is seen.
	    </ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Recording</span>: This records
	    various counts of things that happen during an experiment.
	    Separate different counts with commas.
	    <ul>
	      <li><code>count()</code> Count the number of flips.
	      <li><code>count(h), count(t)</code> Count the heads and
		the tails.
	      <li><code>count(hh)/count(h)</code> Record the ratio of
		"HH" to "H".
	    </ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Repeat until</span>: The basic
	    experiment can be repeated, this gives a condition on when
	    to stop.
	    <ul>
	      <li><code>total(count() &gt; 10) = 3</code> Stop when there
	      have been three experiments that have had at least 10
		flips.
	      <li><code>total(count(h) &gt; count(t)) = 1</code> Stop
		when an experiment has more heads than tails.
	      <li><code>total(1) = 10</code> Stop after ten
		experiments.
	    </ul>
	  <li><span class="desc">Recording</span>: This records
	    various counts through the experiments.
	    <ul>
	      <li><code>total(count())</code> Record the total number
		of flips overall.
	      <li><code>total(count(h))</code> Record the total number
		of heads overall.
	      <li><code>total(count(hh) &gt; count(th))</code> Record the
	      total number of experiments where the number of HHs is
		bigger than the number of THs.
	    </ul>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Some notes on how the counts and totals are implemented:
	  <ul>
	    <li>The counts look for an exact match with the pattern at
	      the end of the current list.
	      (On the TODO is to make this more flexible.)
	    <li>The patterns are case insensitive.
	    <li>If the pattern is <code>HH</code> and the flips
	      recorded are <code>HHH</code> then the pattern will
	      match twice.
	    <li>In the totals, it is possible to put expressions that
	      evaluate to true or false (such as <code>count(h) &gt;
		3</code>).  These are counted as 1 for true and 0 for
	      false.
	      So <code>total(count(h) &gt; 3)</code> counts how many
	      times the count of heads is bigger than 3.
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Make the pattern matching more flexible
	</ul>
